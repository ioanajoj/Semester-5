Goal
The goal of this lab is to use more advanced mechanisms for launching parallel operations — the thread pool and the future.

Requirements
Take the same problems as for lab 2, but, instead of directly creating threads, use each of the following:

• Thread pool, in C++.
• Thread pool, in C# or Java.
• std::async() and std::future(), in C++.
• Tasks and futures in C# or Java.

Compare the performance of the various mechanisms.

Write a documentation containing:
for each synchronization primitive used, the rules involving it (for a mutex, what invariants it protects; for a producer-consumer synchronization device, when is it triggered);
what tests have you done, on what hardware platform, for what size of the data, and what was the time consumed.
